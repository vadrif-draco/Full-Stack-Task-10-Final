# AngularHandsOnFullstackCourse

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.2.

## Front-end development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Back-end development server

Run `npx nodemon .\demo-backend\express.ts` to start the back-end server. Make sure you've installed and ran the MongoDB server, make sure you've also installed nodemon as well as all other typescript prerequisites (simply run `npm install` once you open the project...). You can use the linked postman collection in the `demo-backend` folder for testing the API out, or manipulate it yourself at `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
